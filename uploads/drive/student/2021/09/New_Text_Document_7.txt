when redeem a promo code
	two cases to handle:
		1- use wallet
		2- pay with fawry
		3- cancel order


three changes done:
			1- update fawry and masarry callback to rollback a Promo Code
			2- update and restructure course order to redeem when creating an INVOICE insted of redeem it in front 
			3- update function cancel order to rollback a Promo Code (Error found if the order payment is with fawry or massary)

			

problem:
	INVOICE created when click pay. what if i clicked pay and then closed the window?
solution: Create a cron job to check every 24 as fawry



combine redeem when click pay (front end not need to check twice)
